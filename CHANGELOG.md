### Added

- Improved secret detection in integrity suite (JWT, environment variables fallback).
- Added `requirements.md` date format validation.
- Added test to verify `pnpm` version matches `packageManager`.
- Added unit test for `src/index.ts` and enforced index test coverage.
- Configured verbose test output for all test suites.
- Added "Archivos base y ciclo de vida" section to `prompt.md` to instruct agents on replacing bootstrap files.
- Added meta-test to detect remaining bootstrap tests (`dummy.spec.ts`) once real code is present in `src/`.
- Updated `audit` script to target production dependencies only.

### Fixed

- Robust coverage block detection in `vitest.config.ts`.
- Refined cross-platform slash detection to avoid false positives.
- Improved CHANGELOG.md verification to check for the current version's entry.
- Fixed `audit` script to target production dependencies only.
- Fixed relative import with extension for ESM in index tests.

## [1.4.18] - 2026-03-05

### Added

- Meta-test covering em dash in `.integrity-suite/docs/` files (previously excluded from `getFiles`).
- Meta-test verifying `lint-staged` config has ESLint, Prettier, and Markdownlint wired to the correct globs.
- Meta-test verifying `test:meta`, `test:unit`, and `test:e2e` are all present and in the correct order in the `test` script.
- Meta-test verifying the `prepare` script invokes `husky`.
- Meta-test detecting `exclude:` blocks inside the `vitest.config.ts` coverage section.

### Fixed

- Corrected `.gitignore` allowlist matching: removed the inverted `r.startsWith(norm)` condition that made any short prefix (e.g. `di`, `.e`) pass validation.

## [1.4.17] - 2026-03-05

### Added

- Meta-test blocking ESLint overrides that weaken critical AI-safety rules (`no-explicit-any`, `ban-ts-comment`, `no-console`, `no-warning-comments`) for `src/` or `tests/` paths.
- Meta-test auditing `.gitignore` against an allowlist of known-legitimate patterns to detect agent-hidden files.
- Per-file `allowedPatterns` in the linting ignore files test: `pnpm-lock.yaml` is now only permitted in `.prettierignore`, not in `.markdownlintignore`.

## [1.4.16] - 2026-03-05

### Added

- Meta-test blocking arbitrary tool directories (e.g. agent working dirs) from being added to `.prettierignore` or `.markdownlintignore` as a linting bypass.
- Meta-test forbidding `git add` inside the pre-commit hook, which silently defers staged changes to the next commit.

### Fixed

- Renamed `.integrity-suite/docs/REQUIREMENTS.md` to lowercase `requirements.md` to fix a case-sensitivity bug that caused all requirements tests to fail silently on Linux/CI.
- Removed leftover `.gemini` exclusion from `.prettierignore` and `.markdownlintignore`.
- Removed `git add pnpm-lock.yaml package.json` from the pre-commit hook: the staged snapshot is already computed when the hook runs, making the command ineffective and confusing.
- Upgraded `@commitlint/cli` and `@commitlint/config-conventional` from v19 to v20 to resolve known ESM config resolution issues.

## [1.4.15] - 2026-03-05

### Added

- Enforced English-only commit messages and forbidden scopes via two new git-history meta-tests and a custom `commitlint` plugin (`subject-ascii-only`) in `commitlint.config.js`.
- Added meta-test verifying the `commitlint` plugin configuration (rules and inline function) cannot be silently removed.

## [1.4.14] - 2026-03-05

### Added

- Added typographic rules blocking improper English-style usage of the "em dash" as an intra-sentence connector in Spanish Markdown documentation and code comments.

## [1.4.13] - 2026-03-05

### Added

- Added typographic rules blocking improper English-style usage of the "em-dash" (\u2014) as an intra-sentence connector over Spanish translations alongside the README/Requirements documentation (`tests/meta/integrity-suite.test.ts`).
- Included rule prohibiting "em-dash" injection over standard code comments ensuring linguistic compliance and ASCII purity.

## [1.4.12] - 2026-03-05

### Added

- Unforgeable cryptographic integrity check tracking any adversarial changes to `integrity-suite.test.ts` via SHA256 stored inside `.integrity-suite/integrity-suite.sha256`.
- Verified safety tracking of ignoring local `.env` values and arbitrary build output folders like `dist/` or `coverage/` directly in `.gitignore`.
- Blacklisted local bypass arguments injected over scripts masking husky or other git verifiers (`HUSKY=0`, `--no-verify`).
- TypeScript config fortified strictly rendering builds untrustworthy through blocking assertions over `allowJs`, `checkJs`, and enabling `noEmitOnError: true`.
- Testing discipline extended explicitly demanding standardized test file names, penalizing leftover `debugger` breakpoints and completely forbidding unit-tests accessing the OS file system via `fs`.
- `process.exit()` forcefully forbidden from general business logic modules (`src/`) rendering services intrinsically safe.
- Formidable constraints explicitly barring "Dependency Hygiene" defects forbidding duplicates, wildcard (`*`) bounding specs, or dependency type confusion (mixing dependencies targeting into development only paths).

### Fixed

- Prevented early manipulation bypassing window by ordering validation logically inside `.husky/pre-commit` making `git add` execute succeeding `validate-project`.
- Patched `check-version.js` strictly asserting semantic versioning increments via `/^\\d+\\.\\d+\\.\\d+$/` regular expressions.
- Corrected global language parsing checks in `integrity-suite.test.ts` to evade JSON format evaluation.
- Strictened hardcoded secret security policy strictly tying `.env` masking to existent tracking inside the Git Ignore.
- Erased legacy obsolete check around global `.npmrc` matching the PNPM workflow philosophy.
- Dropped aggressive scope restriction block (`scope-enum: never`) from the commit linter object allowing dynamic scopes in production implementations.
- Enforced instruction mapping over `.integrity-suite/docs/prompt.md` banning manual environment variables such as `HUSKY=0`.

## [1.4.11] - 2026-03-05

### Added

- Added pipeline safety expectation for ensuring `pnpm-lock.yaml` presence to guarantee reproducible builds.
- Mandated chronological descending sanity sorting check for the Requirements log history timeline.
- Configured protective timeouts by enforcing `vitest` `testTimeout` and `hookTimeout` properties in `vitest.config.ts`.
- Guardrails implemented bounding the size of all underlying files in `src/` to 300 LOC alongside its `src/components/` specific rule.
- Added explicit AI-safety assertion guaranteeing the baseline rules implementation (`no-explicit-any`, `no-console`, `ban-ts-comment`) in `.eslintrc.json`.
- Imposed rigorous validation against vitest config's coverage path forcing `include: ['src/**']` syntax as well as necessitating explicit existence of the instrumented `src/` mapping schema.

## [1.4.10] - 2026-03-05

### Fixed

- Fixed a typo inside the Level 4 Integrity Suite test name description ensuring grammatical correctness.
- Remedied a dysfunctional `.eslintrc.json` rule which failed to suppress warnings on `no-console` because its file matcher mistakenly targeted `"scripts/**/*.js"` rather than the existing `".integrity-suite/scripts/**/*.js"`.

## [1.4.9] - 2026-03-05

### Fixed

- Eliminated `@ts-expect-error` coverage masking from `vitest.config.ts`, ensuring it strictly conforms to standard compilation without silencing typescript. (Inclusion of `vitest/config` and `node` types in `tsconfig` enforces typing correctness.)
- Hardened Level 3 in the Integrity Suite to comprehensively reject `@ts-expect-error` occurrences alongside its existing `@ts-ignore` prohibition.
- Stripped remaining erroneous `src` argument from the `"test:unit"` script natively in `package.json`.

## [1.4.8] - 2026-03-05

### Fixed

- Strengthened test coverage metrics by enforcing `all: true` and `include: ['src/**']` inside `vitest.config.ts`, ensuring missing tests are properly detected array functionality additions.
- Secured the cross-platform path slashes check meta-test against false negatives by comparing absolute file paths instead of relying only on `basename`.
- Repaired `"test:unit"` script in `package.json` by removing `src` as an incorrect test folder specifier flag for Vitest.

## [1.4.7] - 2026-03-05

### Fixed

- Resolved pipeline inconsistencies: `npx lint-staged` now strictly uses `pnpm lint-staged`, and validation is enforced after `git add`.
- Replaced `--passWithNoTests` flag from unit testing, guaranteeing 100% coverage requires actual unit tests in the directories via dummy files injection.
- Evicted local `coverage/` directory from repository tracking via `.gitignore` caching removal.
- Expanded integrity suite string matching validations to include `console.error`/`console.warn`, account for template literal secrets detection, and avoid false-negative cross-platform tests parsing themselves.

## [1.4.6] - 2026-03-05

### Changed

- Enhanced ESM compatibility and cross-platform (macOS/Windows) node support. Scripts now utilize `node:` prefixes for core modules (`node:fs`, `node:child_process`, `node:url`, `node:path`).
- Replaced the generic `ts-node` development dependency with `tsx` to natively and cleanly support running TypeScript directly in true ESM environments without requiring custom loaders or failing on unrecognized file extensions.

## [1.4.5] - 2026-03-05

### Changed

- Updated `prompt.md` to explicitly state that all source code (comments, variables, functions) must remain in English/ASCII to prevent confusion and test failures due to the Level 4 Hygiene checks.

## [1.4.4] - 2026-03-05

### Changed

- Moved `check-changelog` and `check-version` execution before `test` in `validate-project` script to ensure metadata is validated earlier in the pipeline.
- Upgraded the metadata validation test to enforce the explicit sequence.

## [1.4.3] - 2026-03-05

### Fixed

- Added a robust structural validation test to `integrity-suite.test.ts` to prevent `.integrity-suite/docs/requirements.md` blocks from merging due to accidental missing headers. Ensures strict descending numeric sequence and no duplicate status entries per block.
- Modified the unapproved commit test output message to enforce the user's role ("...Approved by the user before committing").

## [1.4.2] - 2026-03-05

### Added

- Enforced a strict 100% test coverage threshold via `@vitest/coverage-v8` in `vitest.config.ts`.
- Added a new `Level 6: Testing & Coverage` block to the `Integrity Suite` test, assuring the test pipeline blocks any new untested code. `test:unit` now runs with the `--coverage` flag activated.

## [1.4.1] - 2026-03-05

### Security

- Hardened `.husky/pre-commit` hook validation in the `Integrity Suite` test. Added strict RegEx checks to assert not only that the string `pnpm validate-project` exists, but also to forbid common script bypass mechanisms such as preceding the command with `echo`, commenting it out (`#`), or introducing an early `exit 0`.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-03-05

### Changed

- Moved `tests/integrity-suite.test.ts` to `tests/meta/integrity-suite.test.ts` to logically separate it from future unit/e2e tests.
- Updated all internal project references (Prompts, Requirements, Workflows) to point to the new location.
- Removed sample `src/index.ts` file to establish an authentic blank project template.
- Separated testing strategy into `test:meta`, `test:unit`, and `test:e2e` scripts to allow sequential testing across different layers, enforcing all suites to succeed before commit.

## [1.3.5] - 2026-03-05

### Changed

- Hardened `integrity-suite.test.ts` by removing its own escape clauses from code hygiene checks (English-only comments, console.log, TODO/FIXME, bypass directives). The file now evaluates its own code dynamically to prevent internal escapes and guarantee universal rule application.

## [1.3.4] - 2026-03-05

### Fixed

- Refactored `getFiles` in `integrity-suite.test.ts` to use `fs.readdirSync` with `withFileTypes`. This guarantees configuration files at the root of the project (e.g., `.eslintrc.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `config.ts`) are correctly evaluated by security and hygiene checks, preventing false negatives.

## [1.3.3] - 2026-03-05

### Changed

- Enhanced hardcoded secret detection by including `.json` and `.env*` files in security scans.
- Improved secret scanning regex to detect complex assignments, object properties, and Base64-encoded strings.

## [1.3.2] - 2026-03-05

### Fixed

- Reinforced "Commit Lockdown" test to prevent bypasses. The test now strictly requires the existence of the "Historial de requerimientos" section and at least one documented requirement.

## [1.3.1] - 2026-03-05

### Changed

- Normalized infrastructure filenames by renaming `REQUIREMENTS.md` and `WORKFLOW.md` to lowercase (`requirements.md` and `workflow.md`).
- Updated all references in documentation and tests to reflect these naming changes.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-03-05

### Added

- Implemented "Commit Lockdown" mechanism: the Integrity Suite now blocks commits unless the latest requirement in `requirements.md` is explicitly marked as **Approved**.
- Updated `workflow.md` and `prompt.md` to enforce the mandatory commit approval flow.
- Added automated test to verify the "Approved" status of requirements.

## [1.2.2] - 2026-03-04

### Changed

- Reinforced language policy enforcement by explicitly stating requirements in `CHANGELOG.md` and `requirements.md`.
- Added automated tests to ensure `CHANGELOG.md` remains in English (ASCII) and `requirements.md` remains in Spanish.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-03-04

### Changed

- Refined `prompt.md` with explicit instructions on prohibiting Integrity Suite modifications and the responsibility of maintaining `CHANGELOG.md`.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-03-04

## [1.1.7] - 2026-03-04

### Changed

- Reorganized project structure to isolate template-specific files.
- Moved `docs` and `scripts` into a new hidden directory: `.integrity-suite` (originally `.guardian`).
