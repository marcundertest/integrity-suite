# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. This file is strictly maintained in **English** and must only contain **ASCII** characters.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.4.5] - 2026-03-05

### Changed

- Updated `prompt.md` to explicitly state that all source code (comments, variables, functions) must remain in English/ASCII to prevent confusion and test failures due to the Level 4 Hygiene checks.

## [1.4.4] - 2026-03-05

### Changed

- Moved `check-changelog` and `check-version` execution before `test` in `validate-project` script to ensure metadata is validated earlier in the pipeline.
- Upgraded the metadata validation test to enforce the explicit sequence.

## [1.4.3] - 2026-03-05

### Fixed

- Added a robust structural validation test to `integrity-suite.test.ts` to prevent `.integrity-suite/docs/requirements.md` blocks from merging due to accidental missing headers. Ensures strict descending numeric sequence and no duplicate status entries per block.
- Modified the unapproved commit test output message to enforce the user's role ("...Approved by the user before committing").

## [1.4.2] - 2026-03-05

### Added

- Enforced a strict 100% test coverage threshold via `@vitest/coverage-v8` in `vitest.config.ts`.
- Added a new `Level 6: Testing & Coverage` block to the `Integrity Suite` test, assuring the test pipeline blocks any new untested code. `test:unit` now runs with the `--coverage` flag activated.

## [1.4.1] - 2026-03-05

### Security

- Hardened `.husky/pre-commit` hook validation in the `Integrity Suite` test. Added strict RegEx checks to assert not only that the string `pnpm validate-project` exists, but also to forbid common script bypass mechanisms such as preceding the command with `echo`, commenting it out (`#`), or introducing an early `exit 0`.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-03-05

### Changed

- Moved `tests/integrity-suite.test.ts` to `tests/meta/integrity-suite.test.ts` to logically separate it from future unit/e2e tests.
- Updated all internal project references (Prompts, Requirements, Workflows) to point to the new location.
- Removed sample `src/index.ts` file to establish an authentic blank project template.
- Separated testing strategy into `test:meta`, `test:unit`, and `test:e2e` scripts to allow sequential testing across different layers, enforcing all suites to succeed before commit.

## [1.3.5] - 2026-03-05

### Changed

- Hardened `integrity-suite.test.ts` by removing its own escape clauses from code hygiene checks (English-only comments, console.log, TODO/FIXME, bypass directives). The file now evaluates its own code dynamically to prevent internal escapes and guarantee universal rule application.

## [1.3.4] - 2026-03-05

### Fixed

- Refactored `getFiles` in `integrity-suite.test.ts` to use `fs.readdirSync` with `withFileTypes`. This guarantees configuration files at the root of the project (e.g., `.eslintrc.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `config.ts`) are correctly evaluated by security and hygiene checks, preventing false negatives.

## [1.3.3] - 2026-03-05

### Changed

- Enhanced hardcoded secret detection by including `.json` and `.env*` files in security scans.
- Improved secret scanning regex to detect complex assignments, object properties, and Base64-encoded strings.

## [1.3.2] - 2026-03-05

### Fixed

- Reinforced "Commit Lockdown" test to prevent bypasses. The test now strictly requires the existence of the "Historial de requerimientos" section and at least one documented requirement.

## [1.3.1] - 2026-03-05

### Changed

- Normalized infrastructure filenames by renaming `REQUIREMENTS.md` and `WORKFLOW.md` to lowercase (`requirements.md` and `workflow.md`).
- Updated all references in documentation and tests to reflect these naming changes.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-03-05

### Added

- Implemented "Commit Lockdown" mechanism: the Integrity Suite now blocks commits unless the latest requirement in `requirements.md` is explicitly marked as **Approved**.
- Updated `workflow.md` and `prompt.md` to enforce the mandatory commit approval flow.
- Added automated test to verify the "Approved" status of requirements.

## [1.2.2] - 2026-03-04

### Changed

- Reinforced language policy enforcement by explicitly stating requirements in `CHANGELOG.md` and `requirements.md`.
- Added automated tests to ensure `CHANGELOG.md` remains in English (ASCII) and `requirements.md` remains in Spanish.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-03-04

### Changed

- Refined `prompt.md` with explicit instructions on prohibiting Integrity Suite modifications and the responsibility of maintaining `CHANGELOG.md`.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-03-04

### Changed

- Translated `prompt.md` to Spanish to enforce agent responses in that language.

## [1.1.9] - 2026-03-04

### Added

- Updated `prompt.md` with a comprehensive introduction to the Integrity Suite and agent constraints.

## [1.1.8] - 2026-03-04

### Changed

- Renamed the infrastructure directory to `.integrity-suite`.
- Renamed the main test file to `tests/integrity-suite.test.ts`.
- Updated all internal references, scripts, and ignore patterns to the new naming.

## [1.1.7] - 2026-03-04

### Changed

- Reorganized project structure to isolate template-specific files.
- Moved `docs` and `scripts` into a new hidden directory: `.integrity-suite` (originally `.guardian`).
- Updated all internal references (package.json, tests) to the new structure.

### Removed

- Deleted `developer-kit` directory entirely.

## [1.1.6] - 2026-03-04

### Added

- Enforced prohibition of `markdownlint-disable` directives across all project files.
- Extended the integrity test suite to detect and fail on local Markdownlint bypasses.

## [1.1.5] - 2026-03-04

### Added

- Created `scripts/check-changelog.js` to enforce changelog updates.
- Added a `check-changelog` script to `package.json`.
- Integrated changelog verification into `validate-project` script.

### Changed

- Moved `CHANGELOG.md` to the project root.
- Re-formatted `CHANGELOG.md` to strictly follow "Keep a Changelog" and Markdownlint rules.

## [1.1.4] - 2026-03-04

### Added

- Created `README.md` with installation, usage, and security sections.
- Integrated `pnpm audit` into the validation pipeline.
- Added `build`, `start`, and `audit` scripts to `package.json`.
- Created `src/index.ts` as a clean entry point.
- Implemented `.markdownlintignore` and `.prettierignore`.

### Fixed

- Resolved 4 security vulnerabilities in dependencies (markdownlint-cli, vitest, vite).
- Fixed cross-platform path issues in test suite.

## [1.1.3] - 2026-03-04

### Changed

- Unified all tests into a single `project-integrity.test.ts` suite.
- Reorganized tests into maturity levels (0-5).
- Balanced template flexibility by allowing any non-empty project name/author.

### Removed

- Deleted legacy test files (`strict-commits.test.ts`, `strict-quality.test.ts`, `initial-setup.test.ts`).
- Removed specific license content validation tests.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-03-04

- Implemented cross-platform path separator meta-test.

## [1.0.8] - 2026-03-04

- Updated license and metadata for template reuse.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-03-04
