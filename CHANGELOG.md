# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. This file is strictly maintained in **English** and must only contain **ASCII** characters.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.4.62] - 2026-03-06

### Changed

- Removed integrity hash protocol, deleted file and supporting tests/scripts.
- Deleted integrity-suite.sha256 and associated update-hash.js script and related package.json entry; tests verifying the hash protocol have been removed.

## [1.4.61] - 2026-03-06

### Changed

- Removed manual confirmation prompt from pre-commit hook; the hook now simply runs `pnpm test:develop`.

## [1.4.60] - 2026-03-06

### Changed

- Renamed development flag from `INTEGRITY_SKIP_PROTECTION` to `INTEGRITY_SUITE_DEVELOPMENT`. The old variable has been removed from active checks and is no longer supported.
- `test:develop` now exports `INTEGRITY_SUITE_DEVELOPMENT=true` and the pre-commit hook invokes `pnpm test:develop` by default.
- Documentation (`prompt.md`, `workflow.md`, `requirements.md`) updated to reflect the new environment variable; references to the old flag removed.

### Added

## [1.4.59] - 2026-03-06

### Added

- Version-aware validation tests (Req 141):
  - Strict test: version in staging must be **strictly higher** than HEAD (for commits).
  - Relaxed test: version in staging must be **>= HEAD** (for pushes).
  - Mandatory CHANGELOG entry when version is bumped and ready to commit.
  - Mandatory requirements.md entry with version field when bumped and ready to commit.
  - All records in requirements.md now include explicit **Version** field for tracking.
- Added `test:develop` script and `INTEGRITY_SUITE_DEVELOPMENT=true` environment flag which disables only the core-protection check. This allows maintainers to modify `.integrity-suite/` files while still running `test:full` (the script is used by the pre-commit hook).

### Result

- Prevents commits without proper version bumps and documentation.
- Ensures requirements.md stays synchronized with CHANGELOG for every version change.
- Pre-commit validation now enforces both CHANGELOG and requirements.md presence.

## [1.4.58] - 2026-03-05

### Refactored

- Centralized validation architecture (Req 142):
  - Exported `validateVersion(options)` function from check-version.js for direct testing and reuse.
  - Exported `validateChangelog(options)` function from check-changelog.js for direct testing and reuse.
  - Updated integrity-suite.test.ts to import and test exported validation functions directly.
  - Simplified package.json scripts by inlining linter commands into test:full and test:nobump.
  - Removed redundant scripts: `lint`, `format`, `format:check`, `mdlint`, `audit`, `audit:report`.
  - Created capture-linter-results.js helper to capture ESLint, Prettier, markdownlint, and TypeScript results.
  - Updated validation tests to verify linter integration in test scripts rather than individual scripts.
  - Core-protection test now allows modifications to .integrity-suite/scripts/\*.js files during development. - `.husky/pre-push` now only runs `check-version:relaxed` and `check-changelog`, eliminating redundant full-suite execution on push.

### Result

- Single source of truth for validation logic (tests and CLI scripts use same functions).
- Simplified package.json with only 3 main test entry points (test:full, test:nobump, test:report).
- All 191 meta tests passing with new inline validation architecture.
- Foundation for integrated HTML report generation with linter results.

## [1.4.57] - 2026-03-05

### Added

- New validation architecture with granular test control (Req 141):
  - `test:full`: Strict commit-time validation (renamed from `validate-project`). Runs all checks
    including version bump requirement and CHANGELOG update requirement.
  - `test:nobump`: Relaxed version check for push-time validation. Allows version equal to origin.
  - `test:report`: Standalone script to generate audit report HTML.
  - `check-version:relaxed`: New script variant that permits version==HEAD (used by `test:nobump`).
  - Three new validation tests with tags:
    - `@staging`: Ensures requirements.md is staged during commits.
    - `@version-check`: Ensures version never regresses vs HEAD (runs in both modes).
    - `@version-release`: Ensures version was incremented AND CHANGELOG entry exists (test:full only).
- New `check-audit.js` wrapper script for graceful handling of network failures during `pnpm audit`.
  If registry is unreachable, audit is skipped with warning instead of blocking the workflow.

### Changed

- Renamed `validate-project` to `test:full` across all references (package.json, hooks, documentation).
- Renamed `validate-project:push` to `test:nobump` for clarity about what the validation allows.
- Updated `.husky/pre-commit` to run `pnpm test:full` instead of `validate-project`.
- Updated `.husky/pre-push` to run `pnpm test:nobump` instead of `validate-project:push`.
- `pnpm audit` script now delegates to `check-audit.js` with network resilience.
- Simplified package.json by removing unnecessary test scripts:
  - Removed public `test` alias script (was `pnpm test:meta && pnpm test:unit && pnpm test:e2e`).
  - Removed `test:meta:tag` convenience helper script.
  - Kept internal `test:meta`, `test:unit`, `test:e2e` sub-scripts (only called by test:full/test:nobump).
  - Now only three main validation commands: `test:full` (commit), `test:nobump` (push), `test:report` (report).

### Fixed

- Integrity Suite meta-test updated to verify new script names in hooks and package.json.

## [1.4.56] - 2026-03-05

### Changed

- Removed all `test:meta:*` convenience scripts except `test:meta`; use `pnpm test:meta -- -t <tag>` or
  the new `test:meta:tag` helper for running individual levels. This keeps package.json lean while
  retaining flexibility for debugging specific meta-test groups.

### Fixed

- `check-version.js`: version equal to HEAD is now valid (no mandatory bump per commit). The script
  only fails if the version goes backwards or makes an invalid jump. This unblocks pushes after
  a commit where the version was already incremented in a previous commit.
- `check-changelog.js`: skips changelog enforcement when the version has not changed relative to
  HEAD, aligning with the relaxed version-check policy above.
- `.husky/pre-commit`: removed `pnpm validate-project` from the pre-commit hook. Full validation
  (lint, type-check, audit, tests) now runs exclusively in the pre-push hook, keeping per-commit
  latency low and unblocking day-to-day development on the kit itself.
- `@workflow` meta-test: updated pre-commit assertion to verify `pnpm validate-project` is
  absent from the hook (full validation belongs in pre-push).

## [1.4.55] - 2026-03-05

### Added

- Level 11: Documentation Quality meta-tests (`@documentation`): no placeholder test descriptions,
  JSDoc on all src exports, `@param` tags on function exports, no empty JSDoc blocks.
- `@base`: `.nvmrc` / `.node-version` file existence check.
- `@workflow`: `|| true` / `; true` bypass pattern detection in `validate-project`; pre-push hook
  existence and content validation; `INTEGRITY_SKIP_PROTECTION` absent from scripts and hooks.
- `@typescript`: `noFallthroughCasesInSwitch`, `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`,
  `noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature` compiler option checks.
- `@hygiene`: Commented-out code detection in `src/`; `node:` imports before relative imports.
- `@security`: `eval()` / `new Function()` prohibition; `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` prohibition;
  string-throw prohibition (must use `throw new Error(...)`).
- `@testing`: `.only` / `.skip` modifier prohibition; minimum 4 assertions per unit test file;
  `passWithNoTests: true` prohibition in `vitest.config.ts`.
- `@dependencies`: `engines.node` declaration check; git/file/GitHub-shorthand dependency ban.
- `@consistency`: `var` declaration ban; default export ban in `src/`; nested ternary prohibition;
  switch-without-default detection.
- `pnpm test:meta:documentation` script for granular execution of Level 11.
- JSDoc comments on all exports in `src/index.ts`.
- `.nvmrc` pinned to `v22.18.0`.
- `.husky/pre-push` hook running `pnpm validate-project`.
- `engines.node: ">=22.0.0"` field in `package.json`.
- `noFallthroughCasesInSwitch`, `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`, `noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature`
  to `tsconfig.json`.

### Fixed

- `@consistency`: `===` double-equals regex false-positive on `!==` (lookbehind now excludes `!`).
- `@typescript`: Removed redundant `:\s*any` regex (already enforced by ESLint `no-explicit-any`).
- `@workflow`: `INTEGRITY_SKIP_PROTECTION` environment variable bypass is no longer allowed inside
  any `package.json` script or `.husky/pre-commit` hook.

## [1.4.54] - 2026-03-05

### Added

- Level 10: Runtime Performance and Efficiency meta-tests (`@performance`): namespace imports,
  `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify)`, sequential awaits in loops, full lodash import, sync fs in async.
- `@typescript`: non-null assertion (`!.`), numeric enum, double-assertion (`as unknown as`) checks.
- `@consistency`: `setTimeout`/`setInterval` and floating `Promise.all` prohibition in `src/`.
- `@security`: Extended hardcoded secret detection (bearer, access key, webhook secret, hex tokens).
- `@testing`: Unhappy-path assertion requirement per unit test file; duplicate test name detection.
- `@dependencies`: Major version 0.x detection (with allowlist for known stable 0.x tools).
- `@base`: Commit-msg hook existence and commitlint config reference validation.
- `@workflow`: Hash regeneration script (`update-hash.js`) and `update-integrity-hash` script check.
- `divide()` utility function to `src/index.ts` as canonical example of error-throwing code.
- Unit test coverage for `divide()` including unhappy-path (division by zero).
- New `pnpm test:meta:performance` and `pnpm update-integrity-hash` scripts.

## [1.4.53] - 2026-03-05

### Changed

- Enhanced HTML Audit Report with interactive status filtering and aesthetic refinements.

## [1.4.52] - 2026-03-05

### Changed

- Added premium HTML Audit Report generator via `pnpm audit:report`.

## [1.4.51] - 2026-03-05

### Changed

- Added categorized meta-test execution via new scripts: `test:meta:base`, `test:meta:workflow`, `test:meta:hygiene`, etc.
- Fixed Husky deprecation warnings in `.husky/pre-commit`.

## [1.4.50] - 2026-03-05

### Changed

- Renamed project from `ai-developer-kit` to `integrity-suite` (as current template identity).
- Decoupled Integrity Suite from the project name, allowing its use in any project.
- Implemented **Level HOOK (Physical Interaction)** in `.husky/pre-commit` (Simplified human validation message).
- Updated requirements history to reflect project identity change.
- Simplified workflow: Removed the "Double-Key Approval" system (user seals and secret files).
- Process update: Agents now mark requirements as "Completado" and suggest commits, but only the user performs manual `git commit` and `push`.
- Cleaned up `integrity-suite.test.ts` to remove approval/seal verification logic.
- Removed `sign-requirement.js` script and ".user_secret" references.

## [1.4.49] - 2026-03-05

### Added

- Improved `sign-requirement.js` (now `pnpm run approve`) to prevent redundant signatures and detect if a requirement ID has already been signed.
- Closed a security loophole that allowed reusing approvals for subsequent commits.

## [1.4.48] - 2026-03-05

### Added

- Updated `WORKFLOW.md` and `PROMPT.md` to formally describe the Double-Key Approval System.
- Explicitly forbade agents from proactively reading `.user_secret` or capturing approval command output.
- Defined the "User Seal" protocol as a mandatory manual handshake for all requirements ID >= 129.

## [1.4.47] - 2026-03-05

### Added

- Secured Approval System (Double-Key Handshake):
  - Implemented mandatory `- **Sello de usuario**: [hash]` verification for all requirements ID >= 129.
  - The Seal is a cryptographic signature: `sha256(ID + Status + Secret)`.
  - The agent is technically blocked from forging approvals as it cannot read the `.integrity-suite/.user_secret` file.
  - Added protection tests to ensure the agent never touches the secret file and it remains gitignored.
- Added `npm run sign-req` utility to easily generate the approval hash for the user.

## [1.4.46] - 2026-03-05

### Added

- Level 9: Advanced Code Safety & Consistency meta-tests (Rules 129-137):
  - Forbid mixing `async/await` with `.then()/.catch()` in the same file.
  - Enforce strict equality (`===`) and inequality (`!==`) globally.
  - Enforce object spread instead of `Object.assign()`.
  - Limit code nesting depth to 4 levels (max 32-space indentation).
  - Require explicit type annotations for array callback parameters (`map`, `filter`, etc.).
  - Mandate `unknown` type for error variables in `catch` blocks.
  - Detect potential SQL injection patterns in template literals.
  - Forbid `Math.random()` in sensitive security contexts (tokens, secrets).
  - Prohibit direct `innerHTML` assignments to prevent XSS.
- Added `complexity: 10` rule to `.eslintrc.json` to enforce Single Responsibility Principle at the function level.

## [1.4.45] - 2026-03-05

### Added

- 9 additional HTML structure and semantics meta tests:
  - Validates `<meter>` to require explicit `min` and `max` attributes for correct screen reader boundary deduction.
  - Require `<video>` and `<audio>` tags to declare the `controls` property for accessibility playback.
  - Forbids placing interactive components (e.g. `<button>`, `<a>`) directly inside standard `<label>` tags.
  - Forbids `tabIndex` attributes set greater than `0` to prevent forcing unpredictable keyboard workflows.
  - Fails implementations where an image's `alt` text matches nearby or adjacent literal HTML textual content.
  - Requires `<figure>` contexts containing images to use a valid `<figcaption>`.
  - Audits `<button>` to ensure it is rarely 'mute', validating the existence of direct inner text or `aria-label`.
  - Disallows standard `<a>` nodes from existing without an associative `href` attribute.

## [1.4.44] - 2026-03-05

### Added

- 5 new accessibility checks for form & composite controls:

  - Audits `<progress>` elements to verify proper state projection (`aria-valuenow`).
  - Audits `<details>` wrappers to declare at least one `<summary>` interactive component.

## [1.4.43] - 2026-03-05

### Added

- 5 additional ARIA and semantic form-control meta tests:
  - Restrict `aria-checked` valid context roles (`checkbox`, `radio`, `switch`, `menuitemcheckbox`).
  - Require explicit `aria-modal="true"` declaration within structural `role="dialog"` elements.
  - Assert that references declared in `aria-controls` target a DOM element `id` that exists within the same file.
  - Enforce content availability in label components (block empty `<label></label>`).
  - Restrict explicit implementations of `<input type="image">` to strictly declare accompanying `alt` text.

## [1.4.42] - 2026-03-05

### Added

- Added explicit testing to `.gitignore` to forbid ignoring components of `.integrity-suite` or the `tests/meta` directory, cementing the core protection rules from bypass edge-cases.

## [1.4.41] - 2026-03-05

### Added

- 5 new strict Accessibility HTML tests:
  - Enforce continuous hierarchy for `h1`-`h6` headers to prevent skipping levels.

  - Require focusability (`tabIndex="0"`) on implicit ARIA `role="button"` components.
  - Enfore `<textarea>` includes standard labels/identifiers (`id`, `aria-label`, or `aria-labelledby`).
  - Forbid `href` assignment on `<div>` or `<span>`.

## [1.4.39] - 2026-03-05

### Added

- Meta-test to ensure `<img>` and `<button>` elements with `onClick` handlers explicitly declare a `tabIndex` for keyboard focusability.

## [1.4.38] - 2026-03-05

### Added

- Added extensive DOM, UX, and accessibility validations:

## [1.4.34] - 2026-03-05

### Added

- Meta-test to forbid the use of non-semantic elements (`<div>`, `<span>`) as interactive controls with `onClick` handlers in HTML, JSX, and TSX files.

## [1.4.33] - 2026-03-05

### Added

- Meta-test to forbid positive `tabIndex` values in HTML, JSX, and TSX files to prevent disruption of keyboard navigation order.

## [1.4.32] - 2026-03-05

### Added

- Meta-test to detect potential low-contrast color pairs (hardcoded gray values) in CSS, HTML, JSX, and TSX files.

## [1.4.31] - 2026-03-05

### Added

- Meta-test to ensure all HTML files have a `<main>` landmark element for accessibility.

## [1.4.30] - 2026-03-05

### Added

- Meta-test to ensure all `<input>` tags in HTML, JSX, and TSX files have an associated label (via `id` for `<label for>`, `aria-label`, or `aria-labelledby`).

## [1.4.29] - 2026-03-05

### Added

- Meta-test to ensure all `<button>` tags in HTML, JSX, and TSX files have accessible text (either visible content or an `aria-label`).

## [1.4.28] - 2026-03-05

### Added

- Meta-test to ensure all `<img>` tags in HTML, JSX, and TSX files have an `alt` attribute for accessibility.

## [1.4.27] - 2026-03-05

### Added

- Meta-test to forbid wildcard re-exports (`export * from`) in `src/` to respect the Interface Segregation Principle (ISP).

## [1.4.26] - 2026-03-05

### Added

- Meta-test to enforce Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) by forbidding direct class instantiations within function bodies in `src/`.

## [1.4.25] - 2026-03-05

### Added

- Meta-test to enforce Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) by limiting the number of public methods in a class to a maximum of 10.

## [1.4.24] - 2026-03-05

### Added

- Meta-test to detect unreferenced exports in `src/`, ensuring no dead code is left behind after refactoring.

## [1.4.23] - 2026-03-05

### Added

- Meta-test to forbid functions with more than 4 parameters in `src/`, encouraging the use of configuration objects.

## [1.4.22] - 2026-03-05

### Added

- Meta-test to forbid trivial dummy assertions like `expect(true).toBe(true)` in test files.
- Updated bootstrap E2E tests with non-trivial environment checks.

## [1.4.21] - 2026-03-05

### Added

- Meta-test and `tsconfig.json` configuration to enforce `noUnusedLocals` and `noUnusedParameters`, preventing forgotten imports and variables.

## [1.4.20] - 2026-03-05

### Added

- Meta-test to detect AI reasoning artifacts in comments (e.g., "// This should work", "// Not sure").

## [1.4.19] - 2026-03-05

### Added

- Improved secret detection in integrity suite (JWT, environment variables fallback).
- Added `requirements.md` date format validation.
- Added test to verify `pnpm` version matches `packageManager`.
- Added unit test for `src/index.ts` and enforced index test coverage.
- Configured verbose test output for all test suites.
- Added "Archivos base y ciclo de vida" section to `prompt.md` to instruct agents on replacing bootstrap files.
- Added meta-test to detect remaining bootstrap tests (`dummy.spec.ts`) once real code is present in `src/`.
- Updated `audit` script to target production dependencies only.

### Fixed

- Robust coverage block detection in `vitest.config.ts`.
- Refined cross-platform slash detection to avoid false positives.
- Improved CHANGELOG.md verification to check for the current version's entry.
- Fixed `audit` script to target production dependencies only.
- Fixed relative import with extension for ESM in index tests.

## [1.4.18] - 2026-03-05

### Added

- Meta-test covering em dash in `.integrity-suite/docs/` files (previously excluded from `getFiles`).
- Meta-test verifying `lint-staged` config has ESLint, Prettier, and Markdownlint wired to the correct globs.
- Meta-test verifying `test:meta`, `test:unit`, and `test:e2e` are all present and in the correct order in the `test` script.
- Meta-test verifying the `prepare` script invokes `husky`.
- Meta-test detecting `exclude:` blocks inside the `vitest.config.ts` coverage section.

### Fixed

- Corrected `.gitignore` allowlist matching: removed the inverted `r.startsWith(norm)` condition that made any short prefix (e.g. `di`, `.e`) pass validation.

## [1.4.17] - 2026-03-05

### Added

- Meta-test blocking ESLint overrides that weaken critical AI-safety rules (`no-explicit-any`, `ban-ts-comment`, `no-console`, `no-warning-comments`) for `src/` or `tests/` paths.
- Meta-test auditing `.gitignore` against an allowlist of known-legitimate patterns to detect agent-hidden files.
- Per-file `allowedPatterns` in the linting ignore files test: `pnpm-lock.yaml` is now only permitted in `.prettierignore`, not in `.markdownlintignore`.

## [1.4.16] - 2026-03-05

### Added

- Meta-test blocking arbitrary tool directories (e.g. agent working dirs) from being added to `.prettierignore` or `.markdownlintignore` as a linting bypass.
- Meta-test forbidding `git add` inside the pre-commit hook, which silently defers staged changes to the next commit.

### Fixed

- Renamed `.integrity-suite/docs/REQUIREMENTS.md` to lowercase `requirements.md` to fix a case-sensitivity bug that caused all requirements tests to fail silently on Linux/CI.
- Removed leftover `.gemini` exclusion from `.prettierignore` and `.markdownlintignore`.
- Removed `git add pnpm-lock.yaml package.json` from the pre-commit hook: the staged snapshot is already computed when the hook runs, making the command ineffective and confusing.
- Upgraded `@commitlint/cli` and `@commitlint/config-conventional` from v19 to v20 to resolve known ESM config resolution issues.

## [1.4.15] - 2026-03-05

### Added

- Enforced English-only commit messages and forbidden scopes via two new git-history meta-tests and a custom `commitlint` plugin (`subject-ascii-only`) in `commitlint.config.js`.
- Added meta-test verifying the `commitlint` plugin configuration (rules and inline function) cannot be silently removed.

## [1.4.14] - 2026-03-05

### Added

- Added typographic rules blocking improper English-style usage of the "em dash" as an intra-sentence connector in Spanish Markdown documentation and code comments.

## [1.4.13] - 2026-03-05

### Added

- Added typographic rules blocking improper English-style usage of the "em-dash" (\u2014) as an intra-sentence connector over Spanish translations alongside the README/Requirements documentation (`tests/meta/integrity-suite.test.ts`).
- Included rule prohibiting "em-dash" injection over standard code comments ensuring linguistic compliance and ASCII purity.

## [1.4.12] - 2026-03-05

### Added

- Unforgeable cryptographic integrity check tracking any adversarial changes to `integrity-suite.test.ts` via SHA256 stored inside `.integrity-suite/integrity-suite.sha256`.
- Verified safety tracking of ignoring local `.env` values and arbitrary build output folders like `dist/` or `coverage/` directly in `.gitignore`.
- Blacklisted local bypass arguments injected over scripts masking husky or other git verifiers (`HUSKY=0`, `--no-verify`).
- TypeScript config fortified strictly rendering builds untrustworthy through blocking assertions over `allowJs`, `checkJs`, and enabling `noEmitOnError: true`.
- Testing discipline extended explicitly demanding standardized test file names, penalizing leftover `debugger` breakpoints and completely forbidding unit-tests accessing the OS file system via `fs`.
- `process.exit()` forcefully forbidden from general business logic modules (`src/`) rendering services intrinsically safe.
- Formidable constraints explicitly barring "Dependency Hygiene" defects forbidding duplicates, wildcard (`*`) bounding specs, or dependency type confusion (mixing dependencies targeting into development only paths).

### Fixed

- Prevented early manipulation bypassing window by ordering validation logically inside `.husky/pre-commit` making `git add` execute succeeding `validate-project`.
- Patched `check-version.js` strictly asserting semantic versioning increments via `/^\\d+\\.\\d+\\.\\d+$/` regular expressions.
- Corrected global language parsing checks in `integrity-suite.test.ts` to evade JSON format evaluation.
- Strictened hardcoded secret security policy strictly tying `.env` masking to existent tracking inside the Git Ignore.
- Erased legacy obsolete check around global `.npmrc` matching the PNPM workflow philosophy.
- Dropped aggressive scope restriction block (`scope-enum: never`) from the commit linter object allowing dynamic scopes in production implementations.
- Enforced instruction mapping over `.integrity-suite/docs/prompt.md` banning manual environment variables such as `HUSKY=0`.

## [1.4.11] - 2026-03-05

### Added

- Added pipeline safety expectation for ensuring `pnpm-lock.yaml` presence to guarantee reproducible builds.
- Mandated chronological descending sanity sorting check for the Requirements log history timeline.
- Configured protective timeouts by enforcing `vitest` `testTimeout` and `hookTimeout` properties in `vitest.config.ts`.
- Guardrails implemented bounding the size of all underlying files in `src/` to 300 LOC alongside its `src/components/` specific rule.
- Added explicit AI-safety assertion guaranteeing the baseline rules implementation (`no-explicit-any`, `no-console`, `ban-ts-comment`) in `.eslintrc.json`.
- Imposed rigorous validation against vitest config's coverage path forcing `include: ['src/**']` syntax as well as necessitating explicit existence of the instrumented `src/` mapping schema.

## [1.4.10] - 2026-03-05

### Fixed

- Fixed a typo inside the Level 4 Integrity Suite test name description ensuring grammatical correctness.
- Remedied a dysfunctional `.eslintrc.json` rule which failed to suppress warnings on `no-console` because its file matcher mistakenly targeted `"scripts/**/*.js"` rather than the existing `".integrity-suite/scripts/**/*.js"`.

## [1.4.9] - 2026-03-05

### Fixed

- Eliminated `@ts-expect-error` coverage masking from `vitest.config.ts`, ensuring it strictly conforms to standard compilation without silencing typescript. (Inclusion of `vitest/config` and `node` types in `tsconfig` enforces typing correctness.)
- Hardened Level 3 in the Integrity Suite to comprehensively reject `@ts-expect-error` occurrences alongside its existing `@ts-ignore` prohibition.
- Stripped remaining erroneous `src` argument from the `"test:unit"` script natively in `package.json`.

## [1.4.8] - 2026-03-05

### Fixed

- Strengthened test coverage metrics by enforcing `all: true` and `include: ['src/**']` inside `vitest.config.ts`, ensuring missing tests are properly detected array functionality additions.
- Secured the cross-platform path slashes check meta-test against false negatives by comparing absolute file paths instead of relying only on `basename`.
- Repaired `"test:unit"` script in `package.json` by removing `src` as an incorrect test folder specifier flag for Vitest.

## [1.4.7] - 2026-03-05

### Fixed

- Resolved pipeline inconsistencies: `npx lint-staged` now strictly uses `pnpm lint-staged`, and validation is enforced after `git add`.
- Replaced `--passWithNoTests` flag from unit testing, guaranteeing 100% coverage requires actual unit tests in the directories via dummy files injection.
- Evicted local `coverage/` directory from repository tracking via `.gitignore` caching removal.
- Expanded integrity suite string matching validations to include `console.error`/`console.warn`, account for template literal secrets detection, and avoid false-negative cross-platform tests parsing themselves.

## [1.4.6] - 2026-03-05

### Changed

- Enhanced ESM compatibility and cross-platform (macOS/Windows) node support. Scripts now utilize `node:` prefixes for core modules (`node:fs`, `node:child_process`, `node:url`, `node:path`).
- Replaced the generic `ts-node` development dependency with `tsx` to natively and cleanly support running TypeScript directly in true ESM environments without requiring custom loaders or failing on unrecognized file extensions.

## [1.4.5] - 2026-03-05

### Changed

- Updated `prompt.md` to explicitly state that all source code (comments, variables, functions) must remain in English/ASCII to prevent confusion and test failures due to the Level 4 Hygiene checks.

## [1.4.4] - 2026-03-05

### Changed

- Moved `check-changelog` and `check-version` execution before `test` in `validate-project` script to ensure metadata is validated earlier in the pipeline.
- Upgraded the metadata validation test to enforce the explicit sequence.

## [1.4.3] - 2026-03-05

### Fixed

- Added a robust structural validation test to `integrity-suite.test.ts` to prevent `.integrity-suite/docs/requirements.md` blocks from merging due to accidental missing headers. Ensures strict descending numeric sequence and no duplicate status entries per block.
- Modified the unapproved commit test output message to enforce the user's role ("...Approved by the user before committing").

## [1.4.2] - 2026-03-05

### Added

- Enforced a strict 100% test coverage threshold via `@vitest/coverage-v8` in `vitest.config.ts`.
- Added a new `Level 6: Testing & Coverage` block to the `Integrity Suite` test, assuring the test pipeline blocks any new untested code. `test:unit` now runs with the `--coverage` flag activated.

## [1.4.1] - 2026-03-05

### Security

- Hardened `.husky/pre-commit` hook validation in the `Integrity Suite` test. Added strict RegEx checks to assert not only that the string `pnpm validate-project` exists, but also to forbid common script bypass mechanisms such as preceding the command with `echo`, commenting it out (`#`), or introducing an early `exit 0`.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-03-05

### Changed

- Moved `tests/integrity-suite.test.ts` to `tests/meta/integrity-suite.test.ts` to logically separate it from future unit/e2e tests.
- Updated all internal project references (Prompts, Requirements, Workflows) to point to the new location.
- Removed sample `src/index.ts` file to establish an authentic blank project template.
- Separated testing strategy into `test:meta`, `test:unit`, and `test:e2e` scripts to allow sequential testing across different layers, enforcing all suites to succeed before commit.

## [1.3.5] - 2026-03-05

### Changed

- Hardened `integrity-suite.test.ts` by removing its own escape clauses from code hygiene checks (English-only comments, console.log, TODO/FIXME, bypass directives). The file now evaluates its own code dynamically to prevent internal escapes and guarantee universal rule application.

## [1.3.4] - 2026-03-05

### Fixed

- Refactored `getFiles` in `integrity-suite.test.ts` to use `fs.readdirSync` with `withFileTypes`. This guarantees configuration files at the root of the project (e.g., `.eslintrc.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `config.ts`) are correctly evaluated by security and hygiene checks, preventing false negatives.

## [1.3.3] - 2026-03-05

### Changed

- Enhanced hardcoded secret detection by including `.json` and `.env*` files in security scans.
- Improved secret scanning regex to detect complex assignments, object properties, and Base64-encoded strings.

## [1.3.2] - 2026-03-05

### Fixed

- Reinforced "Commit Lockdown" test to prevent bypasses. The test now strictly requires the existence of the "Historial de requerimientos" section and at least one documented requirement.

## [1.3.1] - 2026-03-05

### Changed

- Normalized infrastructure filenames by renaming `REQUIREMENTS.md` and `WORKFLOW.md` to lowercase (`requirements.md` and `workflow.md`).
- Updated all references in documentation and tests to reflect these naming changes.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-03-05

### Added

- Implemented "Commit Lockdown" mechanism: the Integrity Suite now blocks commits unless the latest requirement in `requirements.md` is explicitly marked as **Approved**.
- Updated `workflow.md` and `prompt.md` to enforce the mandatory commit approval flow.
- Added automated test to verify the "Approved" status of requirements.

## [1.2.2] - 2026-03-04

### Changed

- Reinforced language policy enforcement by explicitly stating requirements in `CHANGELOG.md` and `requirements.md`.
- Added automated tests to ensure `CHANGELOG.md` remains in English (ASCII) and `requirements.md` remains in Spanish.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-03-04

### Changed

- Refined `prompt.md` with explicit instructions on prohibiting Integrity Suite modifications and the responsibility of maintaining `CHANGELOG.md`.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-03-04

### Changed

- Translated `prompt.md` to Spanish to enforce agent responses in that language.

## [1.1.9] - 2026-03-04

### Added

- Updated `prompt.md` with a comprehensive introduction to the Integrity Suite and agent constraints.

## [1.1.8] - 2026-03-04

### Changed

- Renamed the infrastructure directory to `.integrity-suite`.
- Renamed the main test file to `tests/integrity-suite.test.ts`.
- Updated all internal references, scripts, and ignore patterns to the new naming.

## [1.1.7] - 2026-03-04

### Changed

- Reorganized project structure to isolate template-specific files.
- Moved `docs` and `scripts` into a new hidden directory: `.integrity-suite` (originally `.guardian`).
- Updated all internal references (package.json, tests) to the new structure.

### Removed

- Deleted `developer-kit` directory entirely.

## [1.1.6] - 2026-03-04

### Added

- Enforced prohibition of `markdownlint-disable` directives across all project files.
- Extended the integrity test suite to detect and fail on local Markdownlint bypasses.

## [1.1.5] - 2026-03-04

### Added

- Created `scripts/check-changelog.js` to enforce changelog updates.
- Added a `check-changelog` script to `package.json`.
- Integrated changelog verification into `validate-project` script.

### Changed

- Moved `CHANGELOG.md` to the project root.
- Re-formatted `CHANGELOG.md` to strictly follow "Keep a Changelog" and Markdownlint rules.

## [1.1.4] - 2026-03-04

### Added

- Created `README.md` with installation, usage, and security sections.
- Integrated `pnpm audit` into the validation pipeline.
- Added `build`, `start`, and `audit` scripts to `package.json`.
- Created `src/index.ts` as a clean entry point.
- Implemented `.markdownlintignore` and `.prettierignore`.

### Fixed

- Reorganized tests into maturity levels (0-5).
- Balanced template flexibility by allowing any non-empty project name/author.

### Removed

- Deleted legacy test files (`strict-commits.test.ts`, `strict-quality.test.ts`, `initial-setup.test.ts`).
- Removed specific license content validation tests.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-03-04
